A *News Reader* desktop application written in Java.

This project was developed as part of my *Distributed and Concurrent Programming* class.

##### Key Features:

- Communication through Java Sockets
- Multi-threading to handle multiple clients at once
- Multi-threading to search the news database for the correct articles more efficiently
- Multi-threading syncronization mechanisms, such as the [ResultBarrier](./common/src/common/ResultBarrier.java)
- GUI is a hot mess written in Java Swing ðŸ¤®
